            implementation concerns are resolved
          - add new sub has_module, as an alternative to can_use that does
            not load the module

0.010     2015-02-15 01:12:41Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - new -raw_from_file option, when content is too long to inline into
            dist.ini
          - new -include_sub option, to include definitions of commonly-used
            helper subroutines

0.009     2014-11-29 06:28:55Z
          - bump minimum required version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, to avoid a

0.006     2014-09-06 08:44:46Z
          - no longer dropping the last character off Makefile.PL (significant
            when several copies of this plugin run at once!)

0.005     2014-06-16 00:18:15Z
          - fix case where Makefile.PL content was not recognized when there

            typos that conspired together in a web of evil

0.003     2014-05-17 17:11:46Z
          - really fix tests this time...
          - new runtime check for versions of [MakeMaker::Awesome] that are
            too old to be compatible with the munging done in this plugin

0.002     2014-05-13 05:03:02Z
          - fix tests that fail when ExtUtils::MakeMaker is at version 6.63_02
